Joining a GraphQL working group meeting is open to contributors who accept the
participation guidelines and code of conduct.

## 1. Review the Logistics

- Consult the
  [Project Meetings hub](https://graphql.org/community/contribute/project-meetings/)
  for schedule, video links, and note-taking docs.
- Meetings typically run via Zoom with collaborative notes in Google Docs or
  HackMD.
- Time zones rotate when possible to accommodate global participation.

## 2. Add Yourself to the Agenda

- Open the agenda document linked for the upcoming meeting.
- Add your name, affiliation, and topic you wish to discuss. Provide supporting
  links (RFCs, issues, PRs).
- If you have an update but cannot attend, mark it as asynchronous and include a
  summary.

## 3. Confirm the Code of Conduct

- Read the GraphQL Foundation Code of Conduct before joining.
- Agree to the guidelines in the GitHub repository README (most agendas include
  a section for explicit agreement).
- If you are representing a company, ensure stakeholders know you will be
  voicing positions on their behalf.

## 4. Access the Meeting

- Join the Zoom link five minutes early to check audio and video.
- Use your real name and add your affiliation in parentheses for quick
  identification.
- Keep your camera on when speaking if bandwidth allows—it helps with
  facilitation.

## Prepare for Agenda Items

- Summarize the problem statement in one to two sentences.
- Clarify the decision you need from the group (feedback, consensus, call for
  review).
- Link to specific GitHub issues or spec sections for context.
- Coordinate with co-authors or implementers to share perspectives efficiently.

## After the Meeting

- Review the published notes to confirm your action items.
- Follow up with GitHub issues or PRs within one week.
- Share outcomes with your local community or working team to keep everyone
  aligned.
