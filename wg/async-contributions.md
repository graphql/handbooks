You do not need to attend every meeting to contribute in a useful way. Use
asynchronous channels to stay involved between sessions.

## GitHub Participation

- Comment on agenda issues, RFCs, or pull requests with actionable feedback.
- Share implementation experience, performance data, or security considerations.
- Clearly state whether you are expressing personal views or representing an
  organization.
- Cross-link related issues to help maintainers trace the discussion history.

## Documentation & Notes

- Improve meeting notes by clarifying summaries, adding links, or correcting
  typos.
- Translate notes or key decisions for non-English-speaking communities when
  possible.

## Community Channels

- Join the [GraphQL Foundation Discord](https://discord.graphql.org) and
  relevant channels (e.g. `#wg`).
- Keep discussions focused, reference agenda items, and capture decisions back
  in GitHub.

## Staying Informed

- Subscribe to repository notifications - all changes are implemented through
  pull requests.
- Track open action items assigned to you and update status ahead of the next
  meeting.
