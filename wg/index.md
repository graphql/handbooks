GraphQL Working Groups (WGs) bring maintainers, implementers, and community
experts together to shape the future of the GraphQL specification and ecosystem.
Meetings are typically held monthly and are open to observers.

## Purpose

- **Advance the spec.** Discuss proposals, review RFCs, and agree on the roadmap
  for new features.
- **Coordinate tooling.** Enable implementers to align on behavior, test suites,
  and interoperability.
- **Surface field feedback.** Capture lessons learned from production
  deployments and channel them back to maintainers.
- **Build community.** Provide a collaborative space where contributors can
  learn and grow.

## Governance

- Working groups operate under the oversight of the Technical Steering Committee
  (TSC).
- Agendas, notes, and recordings are posted publicly in the GitHub repository
  for the relevant working group.
- Decisions strive for consensus. When consensus cannot be reached, proposals
  may escalate to the TSC.

## Working Group Types

- **Primary WG:** Covers cross-cutting topics and specification updates.
- **Subproject WGs:** Focus on specific parts of the ecosystem (e.g., GraphQL.js
  WG, GraphiQL WG, GraphQL over HTTP WG, Composite Schemas WG).
- **Breakout WGs:** Groups tackling a single complex issue to be reincorporated
  upstream at a later date (e.g. Nullability WG, Incremental Delivery WG).

## Participant Roles

- **Chair:** Maintain agenda, facilitate discussions, and ensure follow-up items
  are tracked.
- **Editor:** Maintain the official specs and track normative changes.
- **Implementer:** Share insights from runtimes, tooling, and large deployments.
- **Observer:** Listen in, learn the process, and may comment through GitHub
  issues or Discord chat.
