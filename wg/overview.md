GraphQL Working Groups (WGs) bring maintainers, implementers, and community
experts together to shape the future of the GraphQL specification and ecosystem.
Meetings are typically held monthly and are open to observers.

## Purpose

- **Advance the spec.** Discuss proposals, review RFCs, and agree on the roadmap
  for new features.
- **Coordinate tooling.** Enable implementers to align on behavior, test suites,
  and interoperability.
- **Surface field feedback.** Capture lessons learned from production
  deployments and channel them back to maintainers.
- **Build community.** Provide a collaborative space where contributors can
  learn and grow.

## Governance

- Working groups operate under the oversight of the Technical Steering Committee
  (TSC).
- Agendas, notes, and recordings are posted publicly in the GitHub repositories
  linked from the
  [Project Meetings hub](https://graphql.org/community/contribute/project-meetings/).
- Decisions strive for consensus. When consensus cannot be reached, proposals
  may escalate to the TSC.

## Working Group Types

- **General WG:** Covers cross-cutting topics and specification updates.
- **Subprojects:** Focus on specific parts of the ecosystem (e.g., GraphiQL,
  GraphQL over HTTP, Security WG).
- **Task Forces:** Time-bound groups tackling a single issue, such as a spec
  revision or event planning effort.

## Participant Roles

- **Chairs:** Build agendas, facilitate discussions, and ensure follow-up items
  are tracked.
- **Editors:** Maintain the official specs and track normative changes.
- **Implementers:** Share insights from runtimes, tooling, and large
  deployments.
- **Observers:** Listen in, learn the process, and may comment through GitHub
  issues or chat.
