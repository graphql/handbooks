The GraphQL Foundation’s primary mission is to ensure the continued evolution of
the GraphQL specification and reference implementations. As part of this
mission, we strive to provide collaboration infrastructure that fosters a
culture of community and innovation. Local get-togethers play a crucial role in
this, bringing together developers, library maintainers, vendors, and
enthusiasts to share knowledge and collaborate.

The GraphQL Foundation's Local initiative exists to better support these meets.
This initiative provides a framework for organizing local GraphQL user groups
and offers support to each approved group (hereafter, a “Local”).

## What the GraphQL Local Initiative Offers

We recognize how much effort is required to organize local events: from finding
venues, speakers, sponsors and refreshments to preparing slides, driving
awareness, ensuring inclusivity, and much more - there’s a lot to do! The
GraphQL Local Initiative enables us to lighten your load a little by offering a
modest sponsorship, slide templates, code of conduct, guidelines, swag,
promotion, and more.
