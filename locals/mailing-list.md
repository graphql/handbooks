# Mailing List

Approved GraphQL Local organizers should join the GraphQL Locals mailing list:

https://lists.foundation.graphql.org/g/locals

We will post to this mailing list from time to time with information for
organizers, this may include things like announcements we'd like for you to
share with your attendees or changes to the Locals program, Code of Conduct,
policies and so on.

You can also post to the mailing list to communicate with other organizers, for
example to get or give tips on what equipment to use to record your talks, how
to find a venue, how to attract more sponsorship, etc. It may also be
particularly useful to enable "speaker exchange" as finding speakers is
generally one of the most challenging parts of running any kind of meetup!

Remember that the mailing list is publicly visible, so please do not post
sensitive information to the mailing list.
