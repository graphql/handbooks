Hosting a GraphQL Local? Here are some things to consider! If you need help with
any of these, please do reach out to your contact at the GraphQL Foundation.

### Do you have a venue?

- How many people can it safely fit?
- Does it have specific access requirements? Do you need to register a visitor
  list ahead of time? Does someone need to be at the door greeting?
- Is it accessible to people with disabilities?
- How can people get there using public transport?
- Is it easy to find?

### Do you have the necessary equipment to record the talks/hear the speakers?

- Buying such things are allowed costs for the sponsorship.
- You may upload the videos to your own YouTube channel (please provide us a
  link to it), or possibly to a GraphQL Foundation channel - if you prefer the
  latter, please get in touch.
- Recording is not required, but please be sure to take photographs!

### Are you offering food/drink?

- Are you organizing that, or is it the venue?
- What are you going to do with any leftovers?

### Do you have speakers lined up?

- Even just one speaker can be enough, but it's good to have two.
- Over the lifetime of your group, try and demonstrate a diverse range of topics
  and speakers.
- Reach out to us for help finding speakers.

### When will your next event be?

- Announcing the date of the next event at the current one can help increase
  future attendance.
- We recommend events are every 3 months or so.

### Where can people reserve tickets online?

- See [Platforms](./platforms.md)

### Do you have slides prepared?

- The Local initiative
  [makes slide templates available](./resources#template-slide-deck) for welcome
  and closing remarks, feely available to use by Locals organizers and speakers
  if desired.
- Slides must include mention of the code of conduct.
- Slides should include a photography policy.
