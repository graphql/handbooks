# Promoting an Event

Once you've organized a date for an event and you have speaker(s) committed, the
next most important task is to drum up some attendance! This is one of the most
important parts of running an event, but is also the one that most of us are the
least good at executing on, so here's some things you can do to help improve
attendance.

## TODO list

1. Publish your event on your event platform of choice.
1. Promote your event to attendees of your previous events.
1. Announce the event via your own social media platforms.
1. Encourage your local techy friends to also promote the event, even if they're
   not GraphQL users, their followers might be interested!
1. Attend (or reach out to) other local tech-related events in your area, and
   share details of your event there. Cross-promotion and grass-roots promotion
   can work wonders!
1. Use [Typefully](./social-media.md) to promote your event on the GraphQL
   Foundations LinkedIn, BlueSky and Twitter/X platforms.
1. Reach out to large companies in your locality to whom GraphQL may be
   relevant; help them see the benefit of encouraging their employees to attend.
1. Announce the event in [the GraphQL Discord](https://discord.graphql.org) via
   the #upcoming-events channel.
1. Announce the event via the [mailing list](./mailing-list.md) so other
   organizers know.

Do not be disheartened if there is low attendance for the first few meetings, it
often takes 2-3 meetings for a local to establish itself. Encourage attendees to
bring colleagues and friends to the next one!

## Repeat your messaging!

Post **again and again** on social media - don't get spammy, but chances are the
majority of people didn't see your first message.

1. 4 weeks before the event, announce it as widely as you can.
1. When your speaker(s) promote content, consider reposting it with a note that
   you can meet them in person at your event.
1. 2 weeks before the event, post something interesting about the talks.
1. 1 week before the event, invite people to bring their colleagues.
1. The day before the event, final reminder and last chance to grab a ticket!

## After the event

You want to induce <abbr title="fear of missing out">FOMO</abbr> in people who
didn't attend - share a post about how great the meeting was, the kind of topics
discussed, what unexpected personality was present, what breakthroughs or great
ideas there were, what things that attendees learned (even if
[they're one of todays 10,000](https://xkcd.com/1053/)).
