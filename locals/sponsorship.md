Once you have confirmed you agree to the
[Local Gathering Requirements](./requirements) you will be introduced to a key
staff representative who will be the person to talk to with regard to any
billing/legal enquiries/etc.

We track our community support program via the LFX Crowdfunding tool located at
https://crowdfunding.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/projects/graphql - to add you as a
beneficiary we will need you to provide the following information:

- Contractor / vendor name (your full legal name or the name of the business)
- If submitting as a business, business type (e.g. C corp, LLC)
- Associated mailing address
- Email address and signatory name

Once added, you will receive an email titled something along the lines of
"You've been added to the "LFX Expense" workspace in Expensify!" - please be
sure to action it. To claim, you will submit receipts for approved expenses
after the event; here's more information about the process:
https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/crowdfunding/get-reimbursed

Should you require additional sponsorship, please let us know the details and we
can try and help you find relevant sponsors.

### Caveats

The sponsorship program works internationally in most countries with some
restrictions placed by international laws and payment providers. If you are
based outside of the USA or Europe it might take longer than we would like to
get you set up in the system but we aim to keep you well informed. If it's not
possible for the Foundation to sponsor your events we hope to be able to put you
in contact with local sponsors.
