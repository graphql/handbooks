# Swag

Locals may provide swag to speakers, organizers, or audience members. The
GraphQL foundation has a limited swag budget available to Locals (see the
official
[GraphQL Local Initiative page](https://graphql.org/community/foundation/local-initiative/).

Shipping from the US to other countries can be expensive and lengthy, so for
Locals outside of the United States and Canada, we encourage you to work with a
local promotional products printer in your area to create stickers and/or
t-shirts - you may do so with our permission so long as you follow our brand
guidelines located at https://graphql.org/brand/ (for inspiration, see the
examples at https://store.graphql.org and don't hesitate to reach out if you are
not sure whether your design will meet the brand guide).

You can add the costs of the swag to your [sponsorship claim](./sponsorship.md),
up to a maximum of $70 including shipping. For clarity: at time of writing your
total claims for a quarter can be at most USD $470; that's up to USD $400
sponsorship + up to USD $70 to cover swag.
