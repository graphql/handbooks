# Platforms

You may use the online events platform of your choice to arrange ticketing for a
GraphQL Local. Here are a few:

- https://guild.host
- https://lu.ma
- https://meetup.com
- https://eventbrite.com

In general we recommend that you only use one events platform, using multiple
can dilute the signal and make your Local appear that it will have fewer
attendees thus discouraging participation. Some platforms have the ability to
sync with others to reduce this concern.

Whichever events platform you choose, you must add a TSC member with admin
privileges, they must be able to add other organizers (for example, if you stop
responding to messages) and message attendees. The main reason for this is to
provide continuity to the community.

## guild.host

Many Local Gatherings use https://guild.host because it's powered by GraphQL,
does everything we need for free without obtrusive ads, and is ran by an active
community member. It can also sync with Meetup.com.

If you choose guild.host for your event, make sure to add your group to the
[GraphQL Network](https://guild.host/graphql-foundation/network).
