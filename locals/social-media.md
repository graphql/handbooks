GraphQL has a number of social channels; see
[the Social Media handbook](/social-media) for details.

## Typefully

We encourage you to get involved in posting to our social media! To do so,
please sign up at https://typefully.com/ and then send your username to your
contact at the GraphQL Foundation so you can be added to our account.

When it comes time to promote your next local, you can log in to Typefully and
draft posts to go out on Bluesky, LinkedIn and/or Twitter/X. Once drafted,
please let us know so we can schedule your posts to go out!

## YouTube

We encourage you to video your Local talks, panels and Q&As. Videos can be
hosted on the [GraphQL TV channel](https://www.youtube.com/@GraphQLTV) in a
playlist for your Local and promoted through the social media channels above. If
you prefer, you can host your videos on a separate channel, so long as it
adheres to the [brand guidelines](https://graphql.org/brand/), and the GraphQL
TV channel can link to it in the "GraphQL Around the World" section.
