One of the things that the TSC oversees is
[the GraphQL Foundation grants program](https://graphql.org/community/foundation/community-grant/)
(please read this document in detail before voting). The GraphQL Foundation
provides the money, but the TSC are responsible for setting the scope of the
grant and choosing whose applications are approved/denied.

The grants program process is essentially this:

1. Applicants fill out the Google Form linked in the grants page above.
2. The application is sent to the grants program operations team (currently Jory
   and Benjie); and it is CC'd to the TSC mailing list. Take no action, this is
   just for transparency!
3. The operations team aims to action the application within a week or so; this
   may be by seeking further information or clarifications from the applicant
   (in which case return to step 2), declining the application if it is out of
   scope or of insufficient quality, or forwarding it on to the GraphQL TSC for
   review.
4. Once the application is ready for review, one of the grants program
   operations team will file an issue in
   [the grants category on the discussions board](https://github.com/graphql/tsc/discussions/categories/grants)
   requesting TSC memebrs to vote. The TSC private mailing list will also be
   BCC'd on the reply to the applicant, which is your hint to go check the
   discussions board!
5. TSC members should aim to complete the vote as soon as possible, ideally all
   votes should be received within 2 weeks.
6. The grant operations team will then relay the result of the application to
   the applicant and take care of any next steps (such as paperwork and finances
   if approved).

The TSC are allocated a modest budget; so far we have never exhausted our grant
budget, however if we were to do so we can request additional budget from the
GraphQL Foundation if the TSC agrees this is desired.

Previous grant applications can be found on the discussions board, see the
[Grants category](https://github.com/graphql/tsc/discussions/categories/grants).

Originally the grants program operated on a schedule having review a number of
times per year, but nowadays we aim to be more responsive and handle each
application on an ad-hoc basis. The scope of the GraphQL grant has also become
more precise over time, but we are the ones who choose the scope so if you feel
the scope is too broad or too narrow, open a discussion!
