## Public meetings

As laid out in the
[TSC overview](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/GraphQL-TSC.md#tsc-meetings),
the TSC meets monthly at the beginning of the (public) GraphQL working group.
TSC topics are labelled as such (`TSC` prefix), but any WG member may weigh in
on them. TSC topics are fairly rare because there's rarely need for these
discussions to be TSC specific.

## Confidential meetings

Sometimes, a public meeting is not appropriate for the topics that need
discussion - there may be an element of confidentiality involved. Most TSC
discussions of this kind are asynchronous, but if warranted we may organize an
Ad Hoc meeting. One TSC member will be the champion of this, and will try and
find a time that works for all active TSC and emeriti - quite the challenge.
We've found that aiming for about 6am in Australia makes it so everyone suffers
to a similar amount ;) Benjie can set up a Zoom using the Foundation's Zoom
account. These meetings should be announced at least 2 weeks in advanced via the
`tsc-private` mailing list and the
[TSC Discussions Board](https://github.com/graphql/tsc/discussions).

## GraphQLConf

We like to have a GraphQL TSC dinner at GraphQLConf, mostly for a social! Lee
normally organizes this - so make sure you allocate a day before/after the
conference to attend!
