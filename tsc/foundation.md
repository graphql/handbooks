## Rough mental model

A simple (but slightly inaccurate) mental model for the GraphQL organization is
that the TSC oversees all technical work (the specifications, working groups,
reference implementation, etc) and the GraphQL Foundation oversees everything
else (legal, budget, events, marketing, etc).

## Requesting something from the Foundation

If you need something from the Foundation, email `operations@graphql.org`.

## Asking a question to the board

Two TSC representatives may attend the monthly GraphQL Foundation Board Meeting
(without being Foundation members themselves); these are currently Benjie Gillam
and Michael Staib. Board meetings are listed on the
[Foundation calendar](https://calendar.graphql.org). Should you have a topic you
wish to be discussed, please bring it to Benjie and/or Michael.
