The GraphQL Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is responsible for the health and
direction of the GraphQL specification and related open-source projects. Its
mandate and membership are documented in the
[GraphQL TSC charter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/graphql/graphql-wg/refs/heads/main/GraphQL-TSC.md).

## Responsibilities

- Maintain the technical roadmap and resolve escalated decisions from working
  groups.
- Steward the GraphQL specification, ensuring compatibility and clarity across
  implementations.
- Coordinate cross-project efforts, including release planning and security
  response.
- Uphold community values, governance processes, and the code of conduct.

## Membership

- TSC members are nominated from the GraphQL Working Group community and
  approved by the Foundation.
- Members represent both individual expertise and organizational stakeholders.
- The roster, terms, and voting eligibility are tracked in the TSC GitHub
  repository.

## Decision Process

- Operates by consensus whenever possible.
- Formal votes may be triggered for specification changes, charter updates, or
  budget allocations.
- Decisions and rationales are recorded in GitHub issues or the
  `TSC Decision Log`.

## Relationship to Working Groups

- Working groups escalate major spec decisions or unresolved conflicts to the
  TSC.
- TSC members sponsor new working groups or task forces when strategic
  initiatives arise.
- Minutes from TSC meetings are shared back with the broader community to ensure
  transparency.
