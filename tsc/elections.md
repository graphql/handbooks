title: Elections
---

TSC members are self nominated, and serve a 2 year term. Half of the TSC is up
for re-election each year, if you wish to have your term extended you must
reapply - existing members are **not** automatically included in the election.

TSC members are treated as individuals, we do not technically have any limits on
the number of TSC members that may be employed by the same workplace (i.e. if we
were all hired by a single company tomorrow that would not invalidate the TSC)
and TSC members do sometimes change employer during their term. A diverse range
of interests and opinions is to be encouraged, so please keep this in mind when
voting.

There is currently no limit to the number of terms that a TSC member may serve
back-to-back.

## Actions

Once an election concludes, new TSC members may be added and existing TSC
members may become emeriti. These actions should take place.
