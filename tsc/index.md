First: make yourself familiar with
[graphql-wg/GraphQL-TSC.md](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/GraphQL-TSC.md).

The GraphQL Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is responsible for the health and
direction of the GraphQL specification and related open-source projects. Its
mandate and membership are documented in the
[GraphQL TSC charter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/graphql/graphql-wg/refs/heads/main/GraphQL-TSC.md).

_This is an informal and evolving document, written by TSC members, for TSC
members. Please do edit it with additional useful info!_
