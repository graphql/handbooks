title: Communications
---

Communications between TSC members tends to be somewhat ad-hoc, however for
anything that requires a vote we require _both_ an email to the tsc-private
mailing list _and_ a post onto
[the GitHub TSC discussions board](https://github.com/graphql/tsc/discussions).

Some members prefer email, some prefer GitHub, and some are hard to pin down
through either - you're encouraged to reach out to TSC members directly (e.g.
via Discord, Slack, Signal or other direct messaging) if you're awaiting their
response.

TSC members are encouraged to list their preferred contact methods in the
[TSC member contact directory](https://github.com/graphql/tsc/blob/main/CONTACT.md).
