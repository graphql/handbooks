Your GraphQL TSC term has ended and you're now a GraphQL TSC emeritus... Does
that mean the party is over?

Not at all! Though you can no longer vote, your input is still very welcome, and
you will retain most of the access that you were granted as TSC, including
membership in the TSC repository and `tsc-private` mailing list (unless there's
good reason to remove you from these). You are encouraged to continue
contributing in the way that you did as a TSC member, partaking in TSC
discussions and lending your opinions and experience. Who knows - we may well
see you on the TSC again in future!

Please continue to respect the confidentiality of the resources to which you
have been granted access.
