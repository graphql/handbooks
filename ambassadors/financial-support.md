:::info Only need the excellence checklist?

This is an overview for the Ambassador Program organizers, see
[the Program Overview](./overview.md) for an overview for Ambassadors and
applicants.

:::

## Travel expenses

- Wait for the talk to be accepted through the meetup CfP process
- Review the talk proposal to ensure alignment with the Program
- Can the payment be made beforehand rather than in arrears?

## Honorarium for content creation

- Ambassador applies for an honorarium each time, in a process similar to the
  Community Grant
- There will be a maximum yearly amount available, paid from the Marketing
  budget
- We should publish a guide to the amounts available (once this is agreed)
- A revision process is expected
