:::warning Focused on organizers?

If you are coordinating the program rather than acting as an ambassador, jump to
for partner alignment workflows.

:::

Applications are open year-round and are reviewed by a panel of Foundation and
TSC members as well as the Ambassadors themselves. The Ambassador term is a year
long, Ambassadors who continue to meet the expectations will be invited to join
again at the end of their term.

Applications can be from the applicant themselves, or a nomination from another
community member.

A new wave of Ambassadors will be announced quarterly; the first announcement
was on stage at the GraphQL Conference in September 2025.

## Application Process

Applications and nominations are made through a Google form and can be for
anybody interested in GraphQL who meets the requirements. Responses are sent to
the program organizers and collated into a shared document. Responses should be
acknowledged within a couple of weeks with an outline of when applications are
next due to be reviewed.
