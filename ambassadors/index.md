The GraphQL Ambassador Program was launched at GraphQL Conf 2025 with an initial
cohort of 19 Ambassadors from a wide cross-section of industry sectors and
GraphQL companies. In its first year, the Ambassador program aims to grow with
feedback from the first cohorts of Ambassadors and the wider community into a
program which is truly impactful and supportive.

GraphQL Ambassadors are trusted go-to community leaders driven by a passion for
GraphQL projects and strive to nurture the growing GraphQL community through
working together, education and outreach.

## Ambassador Program Goals

The overarching goal is to increase GraphQL adoption. The Ambassador Program
aims to accomplish this through:

- **Brand advocacy** - developers organically vouch for and promote GraphQL
- **Social proof** - named individuals with high visibility (and a proportion
  from known corporate brands) as Ambassadors
- **Increased GraphQL content** online and off
- **Community building** - increasing the number of “known faces” within
  GraphQL, making the community feel friendly and welcoming to share knowledge
  about GraphQL
- **Community feedback** - both on GraphQL initiatives and Specification RFCs

## Ambassador Benefits

The Ambassador Program also aims to benefit the individual Ambassadors
themselves:

- Professional recognition for expertise and contributions to the GraphQL
  community
- Opportunities to network with other GraphQL leaders, both in your local
  community and online
- A closer relationship with the GraphQL Foundation & project, including
  up-to-date news and insights on upcoming Specification edits and working group
  topics
- Support, funding and mentoring from the GraphQL Foundation for hosting events,
  speaking and creating content
- Exclusive benefits and swag
