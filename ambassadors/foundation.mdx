The Foundation aims to support Ambassadors in the following ways, and will be
working with Ambassadors to shape the initiative into a program which is truly
impactful for the Ambassadors themselves and the wider GraphQL Community.

- Quarterly online meeting with Foundation / TSC representatives:
  - 15 minute presentation from the Foundation on current projects,
    Specification edits and working group topics
  - followed by Q&A
  - time for Ambassadors to give feedback on the current directions of the
    GraphQL project, be that technical (eg Specification RFCs), or community
    initiative focused
- Promotion of the Ambassador as a go-to GraphQL community leader:
  - Website profile
  - Biographies / interviews with each Ambassador
  - Credly badge for social media profiles
- An Ambassador role on the community Discord and an associated private channel
  for networking and discussions with Foundation / TSC / community reps
- Promotion of Ambassador material - conference talk videos and created content
- Exclusive GraphQL swag eg Ambassador hoodie
- Free GraphQL Foundation Conference ticket
- Ambassadors may apply for travel funding to approved conference & meetup
  talks, applications to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis
- An honorarium available for content creation on a case-by-case basis
