title: Organizer Toolkit

Here are some miscellaneous processes outlined for the Ambassador program
organizers.

## Offboarding and Alumni Network

Upon completing a successful term, Ambassadors join our Alumni Network:

- Continued Ambassador Discord channel to answer questions from new Ambassadors.
- Priority CFP notifications for GraphQL Foundation events
- Annual Alumni spotlight blog series

_Note: The first wave of Ambassadors will not be ending their term until
September 2026, the Alumni Network is not yet in place._

## Removal of an Ambassador

- The Ambassador term is a year long, this gives a natural end to a person's
  Ambassador role
- If the Ambassador is found to be breaking the
  [Standards of Excellence](./standards), the GraphQL Code of Conduct or the
  Linux Foundation Events Code of Conduct, the Ambassador role may be removed
  before the end of their term. The Ambassador Program organizers will engage
  with the Linux Foundation for this process as needed.
