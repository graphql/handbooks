The GraphQL Community Grant program is funded by the GraphQL Foundation and run
by the [GraphQL Technical Steering Committee (TSC)][tsc]. The goal of the
program is to provide financial support and incentives for key technical and
community initiatives within the GraphQL Foundation's projects.

The GraphQL Community Grant program accepts applications at any time and reviews
them at least twice per year. Grant applications are reviewed by the TSC based
upon funding that is received as membership dues for the GraphQL Foundation.
This is one way in which the GraphQL Foundation directly supports the ongoing
health of the GraphQL developer ecosystem.

We encourage you to be creative in your grant application, and propose tasks
that are easy to describe, achievable in three months, and bounded in scope.

Examples include:

- Finishing an outstanding RFC task that has been untended
- Getting a major pull request to a Foundation project ready to be merged
- Community advocacy, such as writing a deep-dive blog documenting a specific
  feature, writing a whitepaper, or developing newcomer onboarding guides and
  materials
- Maintaining projects or core systems hosted in GraphQL repositories
- Other user experience improvement ideas for the [graphql.org][] website and/or
  [github.com/graphql][]

We are not funding work on projects outside https://github.com/graphql/ at this
time.
