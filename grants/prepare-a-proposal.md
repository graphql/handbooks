Use this checklist to submit a compelling grant application.

## Step 1: Define the Outcome

- Articulate the problem you are solving and how it benefits the GraphQL
  community.
- Identify target audiences (developers, educators, implementers) and expected
  reach.
- Specify measurable outcomes (attendee count, content downloads, contribution
  increases).

## Step 2: Plan the Work

- Break the project into phases with start and end dates.
- List collaborators and their roles. Include bios or links that demonstrate
  relevant experience.
- Outline dependencies (venue confirmations, tooling integrations, translation
  partners).
- Highlight risk mitigation strategies for the top three risks.

## Step 3: Budget Transparently

- Provide a line-item budget covering labor, tools, services, travel, and
  contingency.
- Note any matching funds or in-kind contributions.
- Clarify payment needs (upfront deposit, milestone-based disbursements,
  reimbursements).

## Step 4: Gather Supporting Materials

- Past examples of your work (event recaps, curriculum samples, open-source
  repos).
- Letters of support or partner confirmations, if applicable.
- Draft promotional plan showing how results will be shared with the community.
- Accessibility considerations, especially for events or educational resources.

## Step 5: Submit the Application

- Complete the form linked from the
  [Community Grant program page](https://graphql.org/community/foundation/community-grant/).
- Attach or link to additional documents as requested.
- Expect a confirmation email within two business days—follow up if you do not
  receive one.

## Step 6: Respond to Feedback

- Be prepared to adjust scope, timeline, or budget based on reviewer questions.
- Provide any requested documentation (e.g., tax forms, invoices) promptly.
- Once approved, sign the grant agreement before incurring expenses.
