:::note This is community-authored guidance

Please note that, as with all articles within the handbooks project, this is
community-written guidance. It may be inaccurate or incomplete, and is **NOT**
the GraphQL Foundations actual policies or rules.

For the canonical information, please see the https://graphql.org website.

:::

To apply, please complete the [GraphQL Community Grant Program
application][application-form].

The GraphQL Community Grant Program accepts applications at any time. Applicants
can only have one active grant at a time, but may re-apply at any time.

## GraphQL Foundation projects only

At this time the grants program can only support work on the GraphQL Foundation
projects - typically that means that it's limited to the GitHub repositories you
will find under `https://github.com/graphql/` (which includes the graphql.org
website).

The community grant has a limited budget, and there are so many worthy projects
in the ecosystem that if we tried to fund them all they'd each come out with
only a few dollars. Instead, by focussing our resources on the foundations core
projects such as the specifications, reference implementations, and
documentation websites, we can best utilise these funds to benefit the GraphQL
ecosystem as a whole.

:::tip Looking for funding for outreach?

If you're looking for funding for local meetups, events, attending conferences,
producing content (physical or digital; textual, audio or video), swag, or other
ecosystem-expanding activities, please look into the [Ambassador Program][].

:::

## International challenges

GraphQL Foundation is based in the USA, which may introduce extra steps
depending on where you live.

## Preparing a proposal

### Ask for help!

You don't have to submit your application on your own. Reach out to working
group members (particularly the TSC) for help and guidance! Consider pinging our
community gardener, `@Benjie`, via the
[GraphQL Discord](https://discord.graphql.org)'s #wg channel.

### Clarity and full details

Your proposal will be analysed as submitted, so please be sure it is clear and
contains all of the details necessary to analyse it.

The description is limited; if you need to provide more information, whether
that be longer form content or images such as diagrams, please link out to a
Google Doc with additional details.

### No AI slop

Please do not use AI/LLMs to generate your submission for you, such submissions
will likely be declined without full review. You can of course use AI to help
you to refine your submission, but keep the AI's changes minimal - you are
submitting the proposal, so it should use your voice.

### Previous experience

Be sure to include details of where you have contributed to the GraphQL
ecosystem in the past, if at all. Have you attended working groups? Submitted
PRs? Do you maintain a key GraphQL project in the wider ecosystem? Have you
spoken on GraphQL at a conference? Organized a local event? Published content
about GraphQL? Helped others on issues on the GraphQL GitHub, or our community
Discord?

It's not necessary to have any of these, but they do help us to identify why you
are the right person to take on this work.

## Timeline

We aim to acknowledge your application within two weeks except during the
holiday periods (particularly the summer and winter holidays). When we do so, we
might ask for more details or changes. Once our initial reviewer is happy your
submission is in a good state, it will be submitted to the TSC for review.

It will take a while for the TSC to review your proposal, and there may be
longer discussions around exactly what the work entails, and the cost for the
work. After that, there are legal matters surrounding creating the contract and
setting you up to receive the payment. As such, you should anticipate that it
may be a number of weeks before the funding period can start. If you're planning
to do the work during a particular window (a gap between contracts, a holiday
period, or similar) then be sure to surface this clearly in the application and
submit well in advance of this date.

Further, your work will require review, and the people reviewing it are
volunteers. It can often be 2-3 weeks before your PRs are reviewed, and
following review further changes or extra details may be requested. Stay in
touch with the contact you have for the work, typically over Discord or Slack
DMs, and don't be afraid to ping via chat asking explicitly for a review for
grant-funded work! Factor these review periods into the timeline of the work,
and ensure that you will be able to complete them.

Once your work has been completed, reviewed, merged and so on, your grant will
be complete. At this point you will submit a request for payment following the
instructions provided to you upon successful application. Once the request is
approved, it may take up to a further 4 weeks to be paid.

## Do not submit multiple concurrent proposals

Each awardee may only take on one proposal at a time. Please submit a single
proposal to be reviewed, and do not submit another until the previous one is
either rejected or completed.

## Applying again

Had a successful grant before? I'm sure we'd love to fund you doing more
excellent work! Please ensure you completed all tasks (including the required
blog post!) and reference the work in your next submission.

The GraphQL Community Grant _can_ be used to fund ongoing work such as
maintenance of graphql-js, but doing so may follow slightly different rules
than the above. Start by applying for funding for the first period, and we can
advise you on the best way forward for further grants.
