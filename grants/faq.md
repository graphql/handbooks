## Do I need to be developing the specification or code to apply?

While we anticipate most applications will be for new technical development and
documentation, we also encourage applications for community-building activities.
Examples include community gardening and neutral advocacy for GraphQL adoption.

## What work is expected?

Applications should describe work that can be completed in two to three months.
Additionally, we'll ask you to write a blog post report after three months
describing your work and its impact on the GraphQL community.

## What amount of money is available per grant?

The grant amount offered will depend on our available funding and the number of
approved grants per cycle. Individual grants are expected to be between $1,000
and $10,000 USD. When you apply you can select what size of grant you feel would
be appropriate, but if approved you may be offered a different amount and it
will be your choice whether to proceed.

## When can I expect to receive a response about my application?

We will review applications at least twice per year; however, we endeavor to
review applications as they come in and you will receive a response within 2
months of review.

## How often can I apply?

You may only have one grant application open at a time, but otherwise as
frequently as you like.

## Who is eligible?

Any individual working in the GraphQL developer community who can legally
receive a payment from a US-based organization, including meeting any local tax
or legal requirements. Please note that this program is not work-for-hire, and
this is not an employment arrangement.

_Only individuals are eligible to receive funding._

## Are there any restrictions on what I produce?

Yes. All outcomes from the grant must be for the benefit of the GraphQL
community, meaning that code must be contributed to public repositories under an
appropriate open source license (generally MIT). Published materials and
documentation should be available to the public and not behind a paywall. We
also expect every recipient to write a blog post summarizing the work they've
done and how it benefits the community at large.

In summary, the GraphQL Community Grant Program is for the benefit of the
GraphQL community. We want everything that is produced under this program to be
usable by our community. Currently, we're primarily interested in work that
directly improves the GraphQL Foundation projects.

## Do I have to sign anything?

Yes, if your proposal is selected you will need to sign the GraphQL Grantee
Agreement ([preview][agreement-preview]) in order to receive the funding. It is
your responsibility to read and understand the contents of the agreement.

## What currencies are grants awarded in?

All grants are awarded in United States Dollars (USD), so they should be
requested in USD. The amount specified in the grant agreement is fixed in USD
and will not be adjusted for currency changes, conversion rates, or any other
exchange-related considerations. Recipients are responsible for any associated
currency conversion or banking fees.

## When are grant funds disbursed?

Grants are typically paid in full upon successful completion of the agreed work.
However, in select cases, individuals with a proven history of substantial
contributions to GraphQL Foundation projects may be eligible to receive a small
portion of the grant amount as an advance. Any such advance is entirely at the
discretion of the GraphQL Foundation and must be agreed upon in writing before
the grant work starts. The remainder will be paid only upon successful
completion of the agreed work.

## How does the review process work?

After submission, the GraphQL TSC's appointed grants representative is notified
and typically reviews the application within two working weeks. If the grant is
clearly out of scope, it will be declined with an explanation. If more
information is needed, it will be requested. Otherwise, the application proceeds
to the full TSC for review, discussion, and voting.

The TSC aims to provide feedback within a further 2–3 working weeks, though this
may take longer depending on schedules or difficulty. If it takes longer than 3
weeks, the applicant will be informed.

At the end of the review process, one of three outcomes is likely:

1.  The application is accepted, and next steps (contract, invoicing, etc.) are
    initiated.
2.  Changes are requested (e.g. revised scope or funding).
3.  The application is declined, typically with guidance for applying again.

Note: Timelines are best-effort and may shift due to holidays, travel, or other
factors.
