Consistent voice and accessible visuals reinforce the trustworthiness of Foundation channels.

## Messaging Principles

- **Empathetic:** Acknowledge developer challenges and celebrate progress.
- **Practical:** Lead with actionable insights and concrete examples.
- **Authentic:** Spotlight real people and real products; avoid hype language.
- **Collaborative:** Invite contributions, feedback, and cross-community partnerships.

## Copy Guidelines

- Write in active voice and present tense.
- Use “you” to speak directly to practitioners.
- Keep hashtags purposeful—limit to two that the community already recognizes.
- Link to canonical docs or blog posts and provide context for why they matter now.

## Visual System

- Apply the latest GraphQL color palette and typography. Store tokens in Figma for easy export.
- Use high-contrast layouts and text overlays that pass WCAG AA standards.
- Provide room for localization by reserving safe margins for translated text.
- Include the GraphQL Foundation wordmark only when space allows for clear legibility.

## Inclusive Delivery

- Add descriptive alt text that covers visual details and the call-to-action.
- Caption all videos and burns-in key takeaway text whenever possible.
- Provide transcripts for livestreams within two business days.
- Avoid flashing animations or rapid cuts that may trigger photosensitivity.

## Escalation Paths

- Report brand misuse or misinformation to the Foundation communications lead.
- Coordinate incident responses with the code of conduct team when necessary.
- Document platform policy changes that could affect community safety or reach.
