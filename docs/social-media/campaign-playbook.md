Use this playbook to scope and execute social campaigns that support Foundation
goals.

## Brief Template

1. **Objective:** Clarify whether you are driving event registrations, content
   consumption, or awareness.
2. **Audience:** Define personas (developers, product leaders, educators) and
   their key motivations.
3. **Key Message:** Summarize the takeaway in one sentence. Align with the
   latest GraphQL positioning.
4. **Call-to-Action:** Choose a single, measurable action (register, read, sign
   up, share feedback).
5. **Timeline:** Map milestones for asset creation, review, publication, and
   retrospectives.
6. **Metrics:** Select primary KPIs (click-through rate, registrations,
   engagement rate, sentiment).

## Production Workflow

- Draft copy variations for each platform, respecting character limits and link
  preview behavior.
- Request design assets at least five business days before publication.
- Secure approvals from relevant program owners (e.g., TSC chair for governance
  updates).
- Load posts into the scheduler with UTM parameters and accessibility metadata.

## Launch Day Checklist

- Double-check links, alt text, and tagging of speakers or partners.
- Monitor comments for the first 30 minutes and respond with clarifying
  information.
- Capture screenshots of positive reactions for the campaign archive.

## Retrospective

- Compile a short report within five business days covering metrics, wins,
  learnings, and follow-up actions.
- Highlight questions that surfaced for working groups or maintainers.
- Flag high-performing assets that should be repurposed for other channels
  (newsletter, docs, blog).
- Update the playbook with new best practices uncovered.
