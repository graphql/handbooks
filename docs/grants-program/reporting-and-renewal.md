Transparent reporting keeps the grants program sustainable and demonstrates impact to the wider community.

## During the Project

- Share brief status updates monthly via email or the grants Slack channel.
- Flag material changes to scope, timing, or budget as soon as they arise.
- Maintain receipts, invoices, and volunteer hours in a shared folder.

## Final Report Template

1. **Summary:** One paragraph recap of the project and primary outcome.
2. **Impact Metrics:** Include quantitative data (attendance, reach, contributions) and qualitative stories.
3. **Budget Reconciliation:** Actual spend vs. forecast with explanations for over/under variances.
4. **Artifacts:** Links to recordings, repos, curriculum, marketing materials, or reports.
5. **Learnings:** What worked, what didn’t, and recommendations for future grantees.
6. **Next Steps:** How the work will be maintained or handed off.

Submit the final report within 30 days of project completion unless otherwise stated in your agreement.

## Renewal Considerations

- Demonstrate that prior projects delivered on their goals and share long-term impact.
- Outline how new funding builds on previous successes or explores new audiences.
- Include testimonials or letters of support gathered from stakeholders.
- Confirm that all financial documentation is up to date before requesting additional funds.

## Recognition & Amplification

- Coordinate with the Social Media Team to announce outcomes and recognize contributors.
- Offer to present at a working group or community event to share learnings.
- Provide quotes or case studies that can be featured on graphql.org and Foundation reports.
