Effective facilitation keeps working group meetings inclusive, efficient, and outcome-driven.

## Before the Meeting

- Publish the agenda at least five business days in advance and pin it to the relevant Discord/git channels.
- Invite subject-matter experts whose input will be required for decisions.
- Assign a note-taker and a timekeeper. Confirm backups in case someone is absent.
- Review outstanding action items and highlight any blockers in the agenda.

## During the Meeting

- Begin with a code of conduct reminder and quick attendance roll call.
- Set expectations for chat usage, raising hands, or speaking cues.
- Timebox each agenda item. Offer to park topics that run over and move them to async follow-up.
- Encourage balanced participation by inviting quieter voices and summarizing points before decisions.
- Capture clear actions: owner, deliverable, and due date.

## After the Meeting

- Publish notes and recordings within 48 hours.
- Update GitHub issues with decisions made or next steps assigned.
- Thank guest presenters and confirm when their items will resurface.
- Review the parking lot items and schedule async resolutions or future agenda slots.

## Templates

- **Agenda:** Title, date, Zoom link, code of conduct reminder, roll call, agenda items with owners, parking lot, action item log.
- **Run Sheet:** Timeline, facilitator cues, and technical checks (recording, streaming, captioning).
- **Decision Log:** Table capturing proposal, decision type (consensus, rough consensus, deferred), and follow-up links.

## Continuous Improvement

- Collect feedback quarterly from participants on pacing, clarity, and inclusion.
- Rotate facilitation or co-chairing to build capacity in the community.
- Share learnings with other working groups via the WGs coordination channel.
