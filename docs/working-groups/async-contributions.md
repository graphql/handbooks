You do not need to attend every meeting to contribute meaningfully. Use asynchronous channels to stay involved between sessions.

## GitHub Participation

- Comment on agenda issues, RFCs, or pull requests with actionable feedback.
- Share implementation experience, performance data, or security considerations.
- Clearly state whether you are expressing personal views or representing an organization.
- Cross-link related issues to help maintainers trace the discussion history.

## Documentation & Notes

- Improve meeting notes by clarifying summaries, adding links, or correcting typos.
- Publish recap posts in the relevant repository or community forums.
- Translate notes or key decisions for non-English-speaking communities when possible.

## Community Channels

- Join the GraphQL Foundation Discord and relevant channels (e.g., `#wg-general`, `#wg-graphql-js`).
- Keep conversations focused, reference agenda items, and capture decisions back in GitHub.
- Utilize the working group mailing lists for formal announcements or consensus calls.

## Staying Informed

- Subscribe to repository notifications with custom filters for issues and discussions.
- Follow the monthly community update or newsletter for cross-program highlights.
- Track open action items assigned to you and update status ahead of the next meeting.
