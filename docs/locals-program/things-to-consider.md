Launching a new GraphQL Local Gathering follows a predictable set of milestones. Use the checklist below to move from idea to your first public event.

### 1. Do you have a venue?

- How many people can it safely fit?
- Does it have specific access requirements? Do you need to register a visitor list ahead of time? Does someone need to be at the door greeting?
- Is it accessible to people with disabilities?
- How can people get there using public transport?
- Is it easy to find?

### 2. Do you have the necessary equipment to record the talks/hear the speakers?

- Buying such things are allowed costs for the sponsorship.
- You may upload the videos to your own YouTube channel (please provide us a link to it), or possibly to a GraphQL Foundation channel - if you prefer the latter, please get in touch.

### 3. Are you offering food/drink?

- Are you organizing that, or is it the venue?
- What are you going to do with any leftovers?

### 4. Do you have speakers lined up?

### 5. When will your next event be?

- Announcing the date of the next event at the current one can help increase attendance.

### 6. Where can people reserve tickets online?

- https://guild.host is a great free option and it runs on GraphQL! Many of our Local Gatherings use this platform, make sure to add your group to the [GraphQL Network](https://guild.host/graphql-foundation/network).

### 7. Do you have slides prepared?

- The Local initiative [makes slide templates available](./resources#template-slide-deck) for welcome and closing remarks, feely available to use by Locals organizers and speakers if desired.
