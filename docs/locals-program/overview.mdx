The GraphQL Foundation’s primary mission is to ensure the continued evolution of the GraphQL specification and reference implementations. As part of this mission, we strive to provide collaboration infrastructure that fosters a culture of community and innovation. Local get-togethers play a crucial role in this, bringing together developers, library maintainers, vendors, and enthusiasts to share knowledge and collaborate.

To better support these meets and clarify the process, we are excited to announce the official GraphQL Local initiative. This initiative provides a framework for organizing local GraphQL user groups and offers support to each approved group (hereafter, a “Local”).

## What the GraphQL Local Initiative Offers

We recognize how much effort is required to organize local events: from finding venues, speakers, sponsors and refreshments to preparing slides, driving awareness, ensuring inclusivity, and much more - there’s a lot to do! The GraphQL Local Initiative enables us to lighten your load a little by offering a modest sponsorship, slide templates, code of conduct, guidelines, swag, promotion, and more.

## Requirements for GraphQL Locals

To ensure the success and consistency of these local events, organizers must adhere to the [GraphQL Code of Conduct](https://graphql.org/codeofconduct/) and [Brand Guidelines](https://graphql.org/brand/), and ensure events are inclusive and accessible. For the full list of requirements, see [the Requirements page](./requirements.md).

## How to Get Involved

We encourage all community members passionate about GraphQL to get involved. Whether you want to organize an event in your local city or simply participate, your involvement helps strengthen the GraphQL community.

To find out more and apply for official recognition and support for your local event, please visit [Launch a Local](./launching-a-local.md).

Let’s keep building a vibrant, supportive, and innovative GraphQL community together!
