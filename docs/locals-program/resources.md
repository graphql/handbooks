- **Speaker outreach message:** Explain the audience persona, talk length, and recording policy. Offer to help shape the abstract.
- **Post-event follow-up:** Thank attendees, recap key takeaways, share recordings, and plug the next meetup.

## Asset Checklist

- Standardized slide deck with GraphQL brand cover, agenda, and code of conduct.
- Canva social card templates sized for Twitter/X, LinkedIn, and Instagram stories.
- Editable name badge and signage pack for on-site events.
- Foundation-approved recording intro/outro bumpers for livestreams and video edits.

## Operational Docs

- **Event run-of-show template:** Minute-by-minute checklist covering setup, intros, transitions, and tear-down.
- **Incident response playbook:** Defines escalation contacts, note-taking expectations, and follow-up actions for code of conduct reports.
- **Sponsorship prospectus:** Lists benefits, audience metrics, and available packages for local partners.

## Reporting Toolkit
