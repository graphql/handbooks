## Mailing list

Please join the GraphQL Locals mailing list:

https://lists.foundation.graphql.org/g/locals

We will post to this mailing list from time to time with information for organizers, this may include things like announcements we'd like for you to share with your attendees or changes to the Locals program, Code of Conduct, policies and so on.

You can also post to the mailing list to communicate with other organizers, for example to get or give tips on what equipment to use to record your talks, how to find a venue, how to attract more sponsorship, etc. It may also be particularly useful to enable "speaker exchange" as finding speakers is generally one of the most challenging parts of running any kind of meetup!

Remember that the mailing list is publicly visible, so please do not post sensitive information to the mailing list.

## Template slide deck

A template slide deck, suitable for the organizer or for use by speakers: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17de9G0--ObyzbNnoFs4dWgedcSEhE7nfOg9G5a8M7SI/edit?usp=sharing (still needs updating to 2025 design - sorry!)

## Example event introduction

A recording of the London GraphQL introduction so you can see how we talk about the sponsors, code of conduct, photography policy, call for speakers, and so on: https://youtu.be/lKeEhbQqjNw?list=PLu_TLSnl46RqT7utOS2iqNn9beOX4bshO&t=789

## GraphQL logos

The GraphQL logo files can be downloaded from the brand guidelines page: https://graphql.org/brand/

## Event platform

You may use the online events platform of your choice to arrange ticketing for a GraphQL Local. Many Local Gatherings use https://guild.host because it's powered by GraphQL and does everything we need for free without obtrusive ads. Alternative platforms include Meetup.com, eventbrite.com, lu.ma, and many others.

In general we recommend that you only use one events platform, using multiple can dilute the signal and make your Local appear that it will have fewer attendees thus discouraging participation, however some platforms have the ability to sync with others to reduce this concern (e.g. guild.host can sync with Meetup).

Whichever events platform you choose, you must add a TSC member with admin privileges, they must be able to add other organizers (for example, if you stop responding to messages) and message attendees. The main reason for this is to provide continuity to the community.

## Swag

Shipping from the US to other countries can be expensive and lengthy, so we encourage you to work with a local promotional products printer in your area to create stickers and/or t-shirts - you may do so with our permission so long as you follow our brand guidelines located at https://graphql.org/brand/ (for inspiration, see the examples at https://store.graphql.org and don't hesitate to reach out if you are not sure whether your design will meet the brand guide). You can add the costs of the swag to your [sponsorship claim](./sponsorship.md), up to a maximum of $70 including shipping. For clarity: your total claims for a quarter can be at most USD $270; that's up to USD $200 sponsorship + up to USD $70 to cover swag.
