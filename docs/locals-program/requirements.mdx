:::

Organizers of a Local must agree:

- All official events and related channels will be governed by the
  **[GraphQL Code of Conduct](https://graphql.org/codeofconduct/)**.
- Official communications will comply with the
  **[GraphQL Brand Guidelines](https://graphql.org/brand/)**.
- At least one
  [GraphQL Technical Steering Committee (TSC)
  member](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/GraphQL-TSC.md#tsc-members)
  must be granted administrator access to the Local’s online platforms.
  - Provides continuity for group members should we lose contact with an
    organizer.
  - If you don't know any TSC members, one will be recommended when you apply.
  - In the case of a serious Code of Conduct breach, the TSC may take
    appropriate actions.
- The Local has 1 or more organizer from the area. (We're pretty flexible on the
  definition of "from the area", just be reasonable.)
- Each official event will have at least one **organizer present**.
- Official events will be held in an appropriate **professional setting**.
- Official events will feature at least one signficant GraphQL-related activity:
  - Talk: lecture, lightning talk, panel, AMA, etc
  - Q&A
  - Discussion / roundtable / birds of a feather
  - Workshop / coding challenge / hackathon
  - Live podcast/video recording
  - Other ideas? Reach out!
- These **activities will be recorded**, or photographed if recording isn’t practical
  or appropriate, and made freely available online with or without editing.
  - Publishing to [@GraphQLFoundationTalks on
    YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@GraphQLFoundationTalks) is possible - just
    ask!
    - In the case that events are in a language other than English, it may be possible to host videos on a language-specific GraphQL YouTube channel
- Official events will be be **announced at least two weeks in advance**.
  Popular ticketing platforms include Eventbrite, Guild.host, and Meetup.com.
- Attending official events will be **affordable**.
  - If not free, attendance fees must not exceed USD $10 or local equivalent
    without explicit approval from the GraphQL Marketing and Content committee.
    Events charging fees waive their entitlement to GraphQL Foundation
    sponsorship.
- Organizers will **report back on attendance**, general feedback, and any
  suggestions for future events in a timely manner.

Groups may of course organize other events, e.g. a summer barbeque, but these
are currently out-of-scope of GraphQL Foundation support. These other events
shall not be referred to as "official", but are still encouraged to follow the
guidelines that are applicable (in particular, the Code of Conduct and Brand
Guidelines must still be honoured).
