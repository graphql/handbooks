The Locals Program supports community-led meetups that bring GraphQL practitioners together in cities and regions around the world. Successful chapters focus on consistent gatherings, high-quality learning experiences, and inclusive participation.

## Program Vision

- **Grow GraphQL adoption.** Surface practical use cases and success stories so practitioners see how GraphQL works in production.
- **Cultivate community leaders.** Empower organizers to host safe, welcoming events that reflect Foundation standards.
- **Create feedback loops.** Capture product learnings from the field and funnel them back to maintainers and working groups.

## Core Roles

- **Lead Organizer:** Owns the roadmap for the chapter, coordinates volunteers, and acts as the point of contact with the Foundation.
- **Co-organizers:** Help with speaker sourcing, venue logistics, marketing, and day-of support.
- **Community Partners:** Local companies, universities, or meetup platforms that can lend space, sponsorship, or promotion.

## Participation Commitments

Organizers agree to:

- Publish a public code of conduct based on the [GraphQL Foundation Code of Conduct](https://graphql.org/codeofconduct).
- Host a minimum of four events per year, or communicate pauses early if circumstances change.
- Collect feedback from attendees after every event and share highlights with the Foundation.
- Maintain accurate contact and social details in the chapter directory.

## Success Metrics

Track the following to demonstrate program health:

- RSVP to attendance conversion rate of 60% or higher.
- Speaker pipeline filled at least one event ahead.
- Post-event survey response rate above 25%.
- Maintained diversity of formats (talks, panels, workshops) across the calendar year.
