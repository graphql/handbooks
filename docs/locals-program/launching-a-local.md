Launching a new GraphQL Local chapter follows a predictable set of milestones. Use the checklist below to move from idea to your first public event.

## 1. Validate Interest

1. Identify at least ten practitioners who would attend. Gather the companies, roles, and use cases they represent.
2. Map any overlapping communities (React, API, startup ecosystems) that you can partner with.
3. Draft a short “Why now” statement describing the appetite for GraphQL knowledge in your area.

## 2. Form the Organizer Team

- Recruit one to two co-organizers who can commit to three consecutive events.
- Confirm that at least one organizer can provide a venue or has budget to rent space.
- Align on a shared communications channel (e.g., Slack, email thread) and the decision-making process.

## 3. Submit the Interest Form

Complete the Locals Program application linked from the [GraphQL Foundation Local Initiative page](https://graphql.org/community/foundation/local-initiative/). Be ready to provide:

- Organizer bios and contact information.
- Planned event cadence for the first six months.
- Your local code of conduct URL or draft.
- Channels you will use for registration and promotion.

Expect a response within two weeks. The Foundation may ask for clarifications or a short video chat.

## 4. Prepare the Launch Kit

Once approved:

- Request access to the official brand assets package and shared Canva templates.
- Set up a landing page on Meetup, Eventbrite, or your chosen platform. Include links to the global GraphQL community spaces.
- Announce your roadmap for the first three events, highlighting themes or target audiences.
- Schedule your launch event date at least four weeks out to allow time for promotion.

## 5. Confirm Support

- Secure sponsorship for venue, food, or livestream needs.
- Finalize at least two speakers or activity segments for the launch program.
- Ask the Foundation communications team to amplify the event through GraphQL’s social channels.
- Share the finalized agenda and logistics with volunteers one week prior to the event.

## 6. After the First Event

- Send a thank-you email to attendees with slides, recording links, and the next event date.
- Capture wins and challenges in the organizer retrospective document.
- Update the Foundation with attendance numbers and feedback highlights.
- Publish the next meetup within two weeks to keep momentum.
