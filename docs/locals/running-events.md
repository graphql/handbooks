:::tip Planning a workshop?

If you are designing a hands-on lab instead of a talk-focused meetup, skip
straight to [Format Playbook](#format-playbook) for workshop-specific guidance.

Consistent, high-quality events keep your community engaged and help you surface
local GraphQL success stories. Use these guidelines to streamline planning and
maximize attendee value.

## 6-Week Event Timeline

- **6 weeks out:** Lock in venue, format, and budget approvals. Publish a draft
  agenda to the organizer channel.
- **5 weeks out:** Confirm speakers and topics. Prepare a shared slide deck
  template with opening and closing slides.
- **4 weeks out:** Publish the event page with registration link, code of
  conduct, accessibility details, and speaker bios.
- **3 weeks out:** Launch promotion—Foundation channels, partner communities,
  and sponsor newsletters.
- **2 weeks out:** Host a speaker prep call to align on timing, recording
  consent, and key messaging.
- **1 week out:** Finalize run-of-show. Recruit on-site volunteers for
  registration, A/V, and photography.
- **Event day:** Arrive 60 minutes early. Run through slides, test streaming,
  and greet presenters.
- **Next day:** Send recap email, share photos, collect survey responses, and
  update the metrics tracker.

## Quality Standards

- Prioritize sessions that showcase real-world implementations across
  industries.
- Pair every technical talk with inclusive language reminders and
  closed-caption-ready slides.
- Ensure at least one networking element (roundtable, office hours, sponsor
  booths) per event.
- Offer a remote participation option when feasible, using Discord voice
  channels or shared recordings.

## Inclusivity Checklist

- Offer dietary and accessibility options in the registration form.
- Highlight underrepresented voices in speaker lineups and moderation teams.
- Enforce the code of conduct with a visible reporting path and incident
  responders.
- Capture pronouns during check-in and provide badge stickers.

## Measuring Impact

Track these metrics in your post-event report:

- Registrations vs. actual attendees.
- Number of first-time attendees and job roles.
- Net promoter score (NPS) and themes from feedback.
- Content ideas or product feedback to share with working groups.
