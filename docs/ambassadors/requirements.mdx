GraphQL Ambassadors are an important touchstone for people interested in GraphQL
to learn more about it in a friendly and constructive way.

## Attributes of GraphQL Ambassadors

GraphQL Ambassadors are:

- Knowledgeable about GraphQL and readily able to articulate those ideas
- A model community member: adhering to the Standards of Excellence especially
  when critical of GraphQL or defending it against others' criticism; remaining
  respectful, constructive and fair
- Do not come across to other community members as selling another product,
  service or agenda when acting as an Ambassador
- Agree to have your face, name, chosen socials and other relevant information
  displayed on the "people"/"Ambassadors" webpage
- Already participate in one or more of the Ambassador tasks outlined below

## Ambassador activities

- Ambassadors are required to do four or more [Ambassador tasks](./tasks)
  throughout their yearly term.
- Ambassadors are invited to a quarterly online meeting with Foundation / TSC
  representatives for a presentation on current Foundation projects, a Q&A and
  to give feedback on current directions of the GraphQL project (be that
  technical or community focused).
- Ambassadors will be promoted by the Foundation as go-to experts and will be
  featured on the
  [Ambassador Pages](https://graphql.org/community/ambassadors/).
