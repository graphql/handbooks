# Welcome

This site gathers handbooks for the programs run by the GraphQL Foundation. Each section focuses on the outcomes you are trying to achieve—whether you are launching a local meetup, preparing for a Technical Steering Committee agenda, or activating the Social Media team.

Use the program navigation in the sidebar to jump straight to the handbook that matches your current goal. Every document begins with an admonition that calls out optional material so you can quickly decide whether to continue or skip ahead.

## How to Use These Handbooks

- **Start with your goal.** Each page is structured around the key milestones you are trying to hit and the responsibilities tied to them.
- **Follow the checklists.** Step-by-step lists help you move quickly while staying aligned with Foundation standards.
- **Share feedback.** Improvements are welcome. Open a pull request or reach out in the relevant working group to propose updates.
