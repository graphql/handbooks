- **Mentor new contributors.** Help community members navigate contribution pathways, from docs to working groups.
- **Bridge feedback loops.** Surface real-world product insights from companies and developers back to maintainers.
- **Grow equitable communities.** Model inclusive leadership and ensure underrepresented voices are featured.

## Ambassador Profiles
