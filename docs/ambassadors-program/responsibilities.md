Ambassadors agree to lead with generosity, accuracy, and inclusion. Use this page as your accountability checklist each quarter.

## Core Responsibilities

- Maintain an up-to-date public profile outlining your areas of expertise and contact channels.
- Publish or present at least one substantial piece of educational content per quarter (blog, talk, workshop, livestream).
- Provide mentorship through office hours, community forums, or direct introductions.
- Report back on community sentiment, recurring technical questions, and product feedback.
- Uphold the GraphQL Foundation Code of Conduct in any space where you represent the program.

## Quarterly Planning Cadence

- **Week 1:** Share your planned initiatives with fellow ambassadors and Foundation staff.
- **Week 5:** Submit a mid-quarter update that includes metrics and blockers.
- **Week 12:** Deliver a retrospective with outcomes, learnings, and next-quarter goals.

## Standards of Excellence

Align your work with the program’s standards:

- **Integrity:** Present verified information, cite sources, and clarify when you are sharing personal opinions.
- **Inclusion:** Recruit diverse speakers and co-hosts, apply accessible design patterns, and spotlight emerging voices.
- **Impact:** Focus on actionable knowledge—code samples, architecture deep dives, or field guides that practitioners can adopt quickly.
- **Collaboration:** Coordinate with other ambassadors to avoid overlap and amplify larger initiatives.

## Measuring Success

Track both quantitative and qualitative signals:

- Audience size, engagement rates, or workshop completion metrics.
- Community success stories unlocked through your mentorship.
- Contributions from mentees who go on to speak, write, or contribute to specs and tooling.
- Product feedback loops closed (e.g., issues filed, RFC comments, feature validation).
