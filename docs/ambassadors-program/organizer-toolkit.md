Program organizers coordinate onboarding, match ambassadors with opportunities, and keep the global community aligned.

## Intake & Onboarding

- Review applications weekly and respond within 10 business days.
- Schedule a welcome call to review expectations, available resources, and current initiatives.
- Provide access to the shared ambassador workspace, calendar, and content tracker.
- Pair new ambassadors with a mentor for their first quarter.

## Opportunity Matching

- Maintain a backlog of speaking requests, content ideas, and mentorship asks from the community.
- Tag opportunities by region, language, skill focus, and required time commitment.
- Facilitate introductions between ambassadors and working group leads when technical alignment is needed.
- Track outcomes in the program CRM to inform future support.

## Enablement Rhythm

- Host a monthly sync covering major launches, upcoming events, and cross-collaboration opportunities.
- Share a curated digest of GraphQL updates, RFCs, and tooling news to keep ambassadors current.
- Organize quarterly skill-building sessions (e.g., storytelling, recording gear, localization strategies).

## Risk Management

- Monitor ambassador activity for alignment with the code of conduct and brand usage guidelines.
- Provide coaching or corrective feedback quickly when concerns arise.
- Have a documented offboarding path that includes returning assets and updating public listings.
- Collect exit interviews to improve future cohorts.
