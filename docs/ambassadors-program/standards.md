Ambassadors commit to a repeatable bar of quality across all engagements. Use this rubric to prepare for check-ins or renewals.

## Impact Pillars

| Pillar | Indicators | Reflection Prompts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Community Reach | Growth in followers, newsletter subscribers, or meetup members | Which audiences did you activate? How did you localize content? |
| Educational Value | Depth of code samples, clarity of demos, availability of translations | What did learners build or understand after your session? |
| Collaboration | Joint projects with fellow ambassadors, working groups, or partner orgs | How did collective efforts amplify results? |
| Stewardship | Responsiveness to code of conduct issues, accuracy of messaging | Where did you model Foundation values? |

## Evaluation Cadence

- **Mid-year review:** Focus on progress toward your six-month plan and adjust goals if priorities shift.
- **Annual renewal:** Provide metrics, sample content, testimonials, and roadmap. Highlight how you enabled at least one new ambassador or organizer.
- **Ad-hoc feedback:** Foundation staff may reach out after major launches or events for quick retrospectives.

## Self-Assessment Template

1. **Highlights:** Top three outcomes with supporting metrics or qualitative impact.
2. **Community Stories:** Concrete examples of people or teams you supported.
3. **Amplification:** Channels used and cross-program collaborations.
4. **Learnings:** Obstacles you encountered and the pivots you made.
5. **Next Steps:** Goals for the next two quarters plus support needed.

## Consequences & Support

- Missed commitments trigger a coaching conversation and a refreshed plan.
- Repeated misalignment may lead to paused status or removal from the program.
- Reach out early if you anticipate conflicts so the organizer team can redistribute opportunities.
