The GraphQL Ambassador Program was launched at GraphQL Conf 2025 with an initial
cohort of 19 Ambassadors from a wide cross-section of industry sectors and
GraphQL companies. In its first year, the Ambassador program aims to grow with
feedback from the first cohorts Ambassadors and the wider community into a
program which is truly impactful and supportive.

## Program Aims

Increase the adoption of GraphQL through brand advocacy, social proof, more
content and learning resources, and greater community visibility; and gain
community feedback on GraphQL initiatives and RFCs

## Become a GraphQL Ambassador

GraphQL Ambassadors are trusted go-to community leaders driven by a passion for
GraphQL projects and strive to nurture the growing GraphQL community through
collaboration, education and outreach.

As an Ambassador, you also gain the following:

- Professional recognition for expertise and contributions to the GraphQL
  community
- Opportunities to network with other GraphQL leaders, both in your local
  community and online
- A closer relationship with the GraphQL Foundation & project, including
  up-to-date news and insights on upcoming Specification edits and working group
  topics
- Support, funding and mentoring from the GraphQL Foundation for hosting events,
  speaking and creating content
- Exclusive benefits and swag

- **[Overview for Ambassadors](./program-overview.mdx)** - an overview of the
  GraphQL Ambassador Program for the Ambassadors and applicants themselves.

  working group and other interested parties) outlining the goals, outcomes and
  tasks of the program.
