The GraphQL Ambassador Program was launched at GraphQL Conf 2025 with an initial cohort of 19 Ambassadors from a wide cross-section of industry sectors and GraphQL companies. In its first year, the Ambassador program aims to grow with feedback from the first cohorts Ambassadors and the wider community into a program which is truly impactful and supportive.

## Program Aims

Increase the adoption of GraphQL through brand advocacy, social proof, more
content and learning resources, and greater community visibility; and gain
community feedback on GraphQL initiatives and RFCs

## The pages in this handbook

- **[Overview for Ambassadors](./program-overview.mdx)** - an overview of
  the proposed GraphQL Ambassador Program for the Ambassadors themselves, this
  document will become the basis of the webpage inviting the reader to the
  Ambassador application process.

- **[Overview for Organizers](./organizer-overview.md)** - an overview of
  the proposed GraphQL Ambassador Program for the organizers (the Foundation,
  community working group and other interested parties) outlining the goals,
  outcomes and tasks of the program.

- **[Standards of Excellence](./standards.md)** - Standards of Excellence which all Ambassadors will agree to. While the wider GraphQL community abides by the
  [contributor covenant code of conduct](https://graphql.org/codeofconduct/), a
  stronger set of standards is used for this program as the Foundation will be
  endorsing the Ambassadors as go-to community leaders.
