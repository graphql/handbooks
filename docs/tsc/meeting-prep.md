TSC meetings follow the general [Working Group joining guide](../working-groups/join-a-meeting.md) with additional expectations for decision-making.

## Timeline

- **7 days out:** Submit agenda items in the shared document linked from the `graphql/graphql-wg` repository.
- **5 days out:** Circulate supporting materials (RFCs, diagrams, budgets) to members for review.
- **3 days out:** Confirm whether your item requires a vote, a straw poll, or is purely informational.
- **1 day out:** Sync with co-presenters, rehearse talking points, and verify access to the meeting platform.

## Pre-Read Expectations

- Keep briefs concise: target one-page summaries with links to deeper context.
- Highlight the decision requested and any deadlines.
- Identify risks, trade-offs, and alternative proposals that were considered.
- Note whether the item has been through a working group review and summarize feedback.

## During the Meeting

- Present a crisp recap of the problem statement and desired outcome.
- Timebox discussions (typically 10–15 minutes) and invite clarifying questions first.
- Capture motions clearly before moving to a vote. The chair confirms voter eligibility.
- Record action items with owners and due dates in the minutes document.

## After the Meeting

- Update relevant GitHub issues with the decision outcomes.
- Announce major decisions in the `#wg-announcements` channel or mailing list.
- Provide public notes or blog posts for community visibility when appropriate.
- Follow up on assigned actions ahead of the next meeting and flag blockers early.
