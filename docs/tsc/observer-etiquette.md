:::info Presenting soon? Review [Prepare for a TSC Meeting](./meeting-prep.md)
if you will be requesting time on the agenda. :::

Observers are welcome at TSC meetings to stay informed and contribute
asynchronously. Follow these guidelines to keep sessions running smoothly.

## Before Joining

- Ensure you have read the GraphQL TSC charter and understand the scope of
  discussions.
- Add your name to the attendee list in the agenda document, marking yourself as
  an observer.
- Read pre-reads to avoid slowing down the meeting with background questions.

## During the Meeting

- Keep your microphone muted unless invited to speak by the chair.
- Use the chat to pose clarifying questions. Chairs will surface them when
  appropriate.
- Respect timeboxes—if a topic raises new ideas, suggest continuing the
  conversation in GitHub.
- Refrain from lobbying for decisions without prior review by the relevant
  working group.

## Participation Paths

- Comment on the agenda with additional context after the meeting.
- Volunteer to help draft summaries or documentation that emerge from decisions.
- Offer to pilot implementation work if you have bandwidth and alignment with
  maintainers.

## Confidentiality

- Most TSC discussions are public, but occasionally sensitive topics arise
  (e.g., security reports). Respect any confidentiality requests made by the
  chair.
- Do not share screenshots, recordings, or quotes outside the official notes
  without explicit permission.
