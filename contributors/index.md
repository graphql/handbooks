At its core, the GraphQL project is organized around the specification, with a
wide variety of supporting implementations and tools.

GraphQL has an active and mutually beneficial relationship with its many
implementations. The GraphQL specification is continuously evolving under the
care of the GraphQL Working Group, which consists of GraphQL spec experts,
contributors to public reference implementations, and implementers. At any given
time, GraphQL specification updates are a combination of anticipatory planning
with documentation of patterns and behaviors that are already proven in
production, sometimes at very large scale.
